# About Us

At Tribu we have the mission to bring fun and education in every family in a sustainable and circular way. We created age appropriate toy boxes for kids to play and for their parents to exchange for a new one when their child outgrows the old toys.

With this subscription based model we aim to reduce the amount of waste that is created by toys being thrown away. 28% of parents throw away toys that are in perfect working condition and we decided to do something about it.

Tribu already saved more than 2000 toys from being thrown away since 2020 when it was founded by two Berlin based Moms.
